Course Case: Apprentice Chef

Case Challenge Part I
After three years serving customers across the San Francisco Bay Area, the executives at
Apprentice Chef have come to realize that over 90% of their revenue comes from customers
that have been ordering meal sets for 12 months or less. Given this information, they would like
to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of
orders. Thus, they have hired you on a full-time contract to analyze their data, develop your top
insights, and build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each
customerâ€™s life cycle.
